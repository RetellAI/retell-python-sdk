        Create a new agent

        Args:
          response_engine: The Response Engine to attach to the agent. It is used to generate responses for
              the agent. You need to create a Response Engine first before attaching it to an
              agent.

          voice_id: Unique voice id used for the agent. Find list of available voices and their
              preview in Dashboard.

          agent_name: The name of the agent. Only used for your own reference.

          allow_user_dtmf: If set to true, DTMF input will be accepted and processed. If false, any DTMF
              input will be ignored. Default to true.

          ambient_sound: If set, will add ambient environment sound to the call to make experience more
              realistic. Currently supports the following options:

              - `coffee-shop`: Coffee shop ambience with people chatting in background.
                [Listen to Ambience](https://retell-utils-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/coffee-shop.wav)
              - `convention-hall`: Convention hall ambience, with some echo and people
                chatting in background.

                [Listen to Ambience](https://retell-utils-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-noise.wav)
              - `call-center`: Call center work noise.
                [Listen to Ambience](https://retell-utils-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/call-center.wav)
                Set to `null` to remove ambient sound from this agent.

          ambient_sound_volume: If set, will control the volume of the ambient sound. Value ranging from [0,2].
              Lower value means quieter ambient sound, while higher value means louder ambient
              sound. If unset, default value 1 will apply.

          analysis_successful_prompt: Prompt to determine whether the post call or chat analysis should mark the
              interaction as successful. Set to null to use the default prompt.

          analysis_summary_prompt: Prompt to guide how the post call or chat analysis summary should be generated.
              When unset, the default system prompt is used. Set to null to use the default
              prompt.

          backchannel_frequency: Only applicable when enable_backchannel is true. Controls how often the agent
              would backchannel when a backchannel is possible. Value ranging from [0,1].
              Lower value means less frequent backchannel, while higher value means more
              frequent backchannel. If unset, default value 0.8 will apply.

          backchannel_words: Only applicable when enable_backchannel is true. A list of words that the agent
              would use as backchannel. If not set, default backchannel words will apply.
              Check out
              [backchannel default words](/agent/interaction-configuration#backchannel) for
              more details. Note that certain voices do not work too well with certain words,
              so it's recommended to experiment before adding any words.

          begin_message_delay_ms: If set, will delay the first message by the specified amount of milliseconds, so
              that it gives user more time to prepare to take the call. Valid range is [0,
              5000]. If not set or set to 0, agent will speak immediately. Only applicable
              when agent speaks first.

          boosted_keywords: Provide a customized list of keywords to bias the transcriber model, so that
              these words are more likely to get transcribed. Commonly used for names, brands,
              street, etc.

          custom_stt_config: Custom STT configuration. Only used when stt_mode is set to custom.

          data_storage_setting: Granular setting to manage how Retell stores sensitive data (transcripts,
              recordings, logs, etc.). This replaces the deprecated
              `opt_out_sensitive_data_storage` field.

              - `everything`: Store all data including transcripts, recordings, and logs.
              - `everything_except_pii`: Store data without PII when PII is detected.
              - `basic_attributes_only`: Store only basic attributes; no
                transcripts/recordings/logs. If not set, default value of "everything" will
                apply.

          denoising_mode: If set, determines what denoising mode to use. Default to noise-cancellation.

          enable_backchannel: Controls whether the agent would backchannel (agent interjects the speaker with
              phrases like "yeah", "uh-huh" to signify interest and engagement). Backchannel
              when enabled tends to show up more in longer user utterances. If not set, agent
              will not backchannel.

          enable_voicemail_detection: If set to true, will detect whether the call enters a voicemail. Note that this
              feature is only available for phone calls.

          end_call_after_silence_ms: If users stay silent for a period after agent speech, end the call. The minimum
              value allowed is 10,000 ms (10 s). By default, this is set to 600000 (10 min).

          fallback_voice_ids: When TTS provider for the selected voice is experiencing outages, we would use
              fallback voices listed here for the agent. Voice id and the fallback voice ids
              must be from different TTS providers. The system would go through the list in
              order, if the first one in the list is also having outage, it would use the next
              one. Set to null to remove voice fallback for the agent.

          interruption_sensitivity: Controls how sensitive the agent is to user interruptions. Value ranging from
              [0,1]. Lower value means it will take longer / more words for user to interrupt
              agent, while higher value means it's easier for user to interrupt agent. If
              unset, default value 1 will apply. When this is set to 0, agent would never be
              interrupted.

          is_public: Whether the agent is public. When set to true, the agent is available for public
              agent preview link.

          language: Specifies what language (and dialect) the speech recognition will operate in.
              For instance, selecting `en-GB` optimizes speech recognition for British
              English. If unset, will use default value `en-US`. Select `multi` for
              multilingual support.

          max_call_duration_ms: Maximum allowed length for the call, will force end the call if reached. The
              minimum value allowed is 60,000 ms (1 min), and maximum value allowed is
              7,200,000 (2 hours). By default, this is set to 3,600,000 (1 hour).

          normalize_for_speech: If set to true, will normalize the some part of text (number, currency, date,
              etc) to spoken to its spoken form for more consistent speech synthesis
              (sometimes the voice synthesize system itself might read these wrong with the
              raw text). For example, it will convert "Call my number 2137112342 on Jul 5th,
              2024 for the $24.12 payment" to "Call my number two one three seven one one two
              three four two on july fifth, twenty twenty four for the twenty four dollars
              twelve cents payment" before starting audio generation.

          opt_in_signed_url: Whether this agent opts in for signed URLs for public logs and recordings. When
              enabled, the generated URLs will include security signatures that restrict
              access and automatically expire after 24 hours.

          pii_config: Configuration for PII scrubbing from transcripts and recordings.

          post_call_analysis_data: Post call analysis data to extract from the call. This data will augment the
              pre-defined variables extracted in the call analysis. This will be available
              after the call ends.

          post_call_analysis_model: The model to use for post call analysis. Default to gpt-4.1-mini.

          pronunciation_dictionary: A list of words / phrases and their pronunciation to be used to guide the audio
              synthesize for consistent pronunciation. Currently only supported for English &
              11labs voices. Set to null to remove pronunciation dictionary from this agent.

          reminder_max_count: If set, controls how many times agent would remind user when user is
              unresponsive. Must be a non negative integer. If unset, default value of 1 will
              apply (remind once). Set to 0 to disable agent from reminding.

          reminder_trigger_ms: If set (in milliseconds), will trigger a reminder to the agent to speak if the
              user has been silent for the specified duration after some agent speech. Must be
              a positive number. If unset, default value of 10000 ms (10 s) will apply.

          responsiveness: Controls how responsive is the agent. Value ranging from [0,1]. Lower value
              means less responsive agent (wait more, respond slower), while higher value
              means faster exchanges (respond when it can). If unset, default value 1 will
              apply.

          ring_duration_ms: If set, the phone ringing will last for the specified amount of milliseconds.
              This applies for both outbound call ringtime, and call transfer ringtime.
              Default to 30000 (30 s). Valid range is [5000, 90000].

          signed_url_expiration_ms: The expiration time for the signed url in milliseconds. Only applicable when
              opt_in_signed_url is true. If not set, default value of 86400000 (24 hours) will
              apply.

          stt_mode: If set, determines whether speech to text should focus on latency or accuracy.
              Default to fast mode. When set to custom, custom_stt_config must be provided.

          version_description: Optional description of the agent version. Used for your own reference and
              documentation.

          vocab_specialization: If set, determines the vocabulary set to use for transcription. This setting
              only applies for English agents, for non English agent, this setting is a no-op.
              Default to general.

          voice_model: Select the voice model used for the selected voice. Each provider has a set of
              available voice models. Set to null to remove voice model selection, and default
              ones will apply. Check out dashboard for more details of each voice model.

          voice_speed: Controls speed of voice. Value ranging from [0.5,2]. Lower value means slower
              speech, while higher value means faster speech rate. If unset, default value 1
              will apply.

          voice_temperature: Controls how stable the voice is. Value ranging from [0,2]. Lower value means
              more stable, and higher value means more variant speech generation. Currently
              this setting only applies to `11labs` voices. If unset, default value 1 will
              apply.

          voicemail_detection_timeout_ms: Configures when to stop running voicemail detection, as it becomes unlikely to
              hit voicemail after a couple minutes, and keep running it will only have
              negative impact. The minimum value allowed is 5,000 ms (5 s), and maximum value
              allowed is 180,000 (3 minutes). By default, this is set to 30,000 (30 s).

          voicemail_message: The message to be played when the call enters a voicemail. Note that this
              feature is only available for phone calls. If you want to hangup after hitting
              voicemail, set this to empty string.

          voicemail_option: If this option is set, the call will try to detect voicemail in the first 3
              minutes of the call. Actions defined (hangup, or leave a message) will be
              applied when the voicemail is detected. Set this to null to disable voicemail
              detection.

          volume: If set, will control the volume of the agent. Value ranging from [0,2]. Lower
              value means quieter agent speech, while higher value means louder agent speech.
              If unset, default value 1 will apply.

          webhook_timeout_ms: The timeout for the webhook in milliseconds. If not set, default value of 10000
              will apply.

          webhook_url: The webhook for agent to listen to call events. See what events it would get at
              [webhook doc](/features/webhook). If set, will binds webhook events for this
              agent to the specified url, and will ignore the account level webhook for this
              agent. Set to `null` to remove webhook url from this agent.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

        Update an existing agent's latest draft version

        Args:
          version: Optional version of the API to use for this request. Default to latest version.

          agent_name: The name of the agent. Only used for your own reference.

          allow_user_dtmf: If set to true, DTMF input will be accepted and processed. If false, any DTMF
              input will be ignored. Default to true.

          ambient_sound: If set, will add ambient environment sound to the call to make experience more
              realistic. Currently supports the following options:

              - `coffee-shop`: Coffee shop ambience with people chatting in background.
                [Listen to Ambience](https://retell-utils-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/coffee-shop.wav)
              - `convention-hall`: Convention hall ambience, with some echo and people

                Set to `null` to remove ambient sound from this agent.

          ambient_sound_volume: If set, will control the volume of the ambient sound. Value ranging from [0,2].
              Lower value means quieter ambient sound, while higher value means louder ambient
              sound. If unset, default value 1 will apply.

          analysis_successful_prompt: Prompt to determine whether the post call or chat analysis should mark the
              interaction as successful. Set to null to use the default prompt.

          analysis_summary_prompt: Prompt to guide how the post call or chat analysis summary should be generated.
              When unset, the default system prompt is used. Set to null to use the default
              prompt.

          backchannel_frequency: Only applicable when enable_backchannel is true. Controls how often the agent
              would backchannel when a backchannel is possible. Value ranging from [0,1].
              Lower value means less frequent backchannel, while higher value means more
              frequent backchannel. If unset, default value 0.8 will apply.

          backchannel_words: Only applicable when enable_backchannel is true. A list of words that the agent
              would use as backchannel. If not set, default backchannel words will apply.
              Check out
              [backchannel default words](/agent/interaction-configuration#backchannel) for
              more details. Note that certain voices do not work too well with certain words,
              so it's recommended to experiment before adding any words.

          begin_message_delay_ms: If set, will delay the first message by the specified amount of milliseconds, so
              that it gives user more time to prepare to take the call. Valid range is [0,
              5000]. If not set or set to 0, agent will speak immediately. Only applicable
              when agent speaks first.

          boosted_keywords: Provide a customized list of keywords to bias the transcriber model, so that
              these words are more likely to get transcribed. Commonly used for names, brands,
              street, etc.

          custom_stt_config: Custom STT configuration. Only used when stt_mode is set to custom.

          data_storage_setting: Granular setting to manage how Retell stores sensitive data (transcripts,
              recordings, logs, etc.). This replaces the deprecated
              `opt_out_sensitive_data_storage` field.

              - `everything`: Store all data including transcripts, recordings, and logs.
              - `everything_except_pii`: Store data without PII when PII is detected.
              - `basic_attributes_only`: Store only basic attributes; no
                transcripts/recordings/logs. If not set, default value of "everything" will
                apply.

          denoising_mode: If set, determines what denoising mode to use. Default to noise-cancellation.

          enable_backchannel: Controls whether the agent would backchannel (agent interjects the speaker with
              phrases like "yeah", "uh-huh" to signify interest and engagement). Backchannel
              when enabled tends to show up more in longer user utterances. If not set, agent
              will not backchannel.

          enable_voicemail_detection: If set to true, will detect whether the call enters a voicemail. Note that this
              feature is only available for phone calls.

          end_call_after_silence_ms: If users stay silent for a period after agent speech, end the call. The minimum
              value allowed is 10,000 ms (10 s). By default, this is set to 600000 (10 min).

          fallback_voice_ids: When TTS provider for the selected voice is experiencing outages, we would use
              fallback voices listed here for the agent. Voice id and the fallback voice ids
              must be from different TTS providers. The system would go through the list in
              order, if the first one in the list is also having outage, it would use the next
              one. Set to null to remove voice fallback for the agent.

          interruption_sensitivity: Controls how sensitive the agent is to user interruptions. Value ranging from
              [0,1]. Lower value means it will take longer / more words for user to interrupt
              agent, while higher value means it's easier for user to interrupt agent. If
              unset, default value 1 will apply. When this is set to 0, agent would never be
              interrupted.

          is_public: Whether the agent is public. When set to true, the agent is available for public
              agent preview link.

          language: Specifies what language (and dialect) the speech recognition will operate in.
              For instance, selecting `en-GB` optimizes speech recognition for British
              English. If unset, will use default value `en-US`. Select `multi` for
              multilingual support.

          max_call_duration_ms: Maximum allowed length for the call, will force end the call if reached. The
              minimum value allowed is 60,000 ms (1 min), and maximum value allowed is
              7,200,000 (2 hours). By default, this is set to 3,600,000 (1 hour).

          normalize_for_speech: If set to true, will normalize the some part of text (number, currency, date,
              etc) to spoken to its spoken form for more consistent speech synthesis
              (sometimes the voice synthesize system itself might read these wrong with the
              raw text). For example, it will convert "Call my number 2137112342 on Jul 5th,
              2024 for the $24.12 payment" to "Call my number two one three seven one one two
              three four two on july fifth, twenty twenty four for the twenty four dollars
              twelve cents payment" before starting audio generation.

          opt_in_signed_url: Whether this agent opts in for signed URLs for public logs and recordings. When
              enabled, the generated URLs will include security signatures that restrict
              access and automatically expire after 24 hours.

          pii_config: Configuration for PII scrubbing from transcripts and recordings.

          post_call_analysis_data: Post call analysis data to extract from the call. This data will augment the
              pre-defined variables extracted in the call analysis. This will be available
              after the call ends.

          post_call_analysis_model: The model to use for post call analysis. Default to gpt-4.1-mini.

          pronunciation_dictionary: A list of words / phrases and their pronunciation to be used to guide the audio
              synthesize for consistent pronunciation. Currently only supported for English &
              11labs voices. Set to null to remove pronunciation dictionary from this agent.

          reminder_max_count: If set, controls how many times agent would remind user when user is
              unresponsive. Must be a non negative integer. If unset, default value of 1 will
              apply (remind once). Set to 0 to disable agent from reminding.

          reminder_trigger_ms: If set (in milliseconds), will trigger a reminder to the agent to speak if the
              user has been silent for the specified duration after some agent speech. Must be
              a positive number. If unset, default value of 10000 ms (10 s) will apply.

          response_engine: The Response Engine to attach to the agent. It is used to generate responses for
              the agent. You need to create a Response Engine first before attaching it to an
              agent.

          responsiveness: Controls how responsive is the agent. Value ranging from [0,1]. Lower value
              means less responsive agent (wait more, respond slower), while higher value
              means faster exchanges (respond when it can). If unset, default value 1 will
              apply.

          ring_duration_ms: If set, the phone ringing will last for the specified amount of milliseconds.
              This applies for both outbound call ringtime, and call transfer ringtime.
              Default to 30000 (30 s). Valid range is [5000, 90000].

          signed_url_expiration_ms: The expiration time for the signed url in milliseconds. Only applicable when
              opt_in_signed_url is true. If not set, default value of 86400000 (24 hours) will
              apply.

          stt_mode: If set, determines whether speech to text should focus on latency or accuracy.
              Default to fast mode. When set to custom, custom_stt_config must be provided.

          version_description: Optional description of the agent version. Used for your own reference and
              documentation.

          vocab_specialization: If set, determines the vocabulary set to use for transcription. This setting
              only applies for English agents, for non English agent, this setting is a no-op.
              Default to general.

          voice_id: Unique voice id used for the agent. Find list of available voices and their
              preview in Dashboard.

          voice_model: Select the voice model used for the selected voice. Each provider has a set of
              available voice models. Set to null to remove voice model selection, and default
              ones will apply. Check out dashboard for more details of each voice model.

          voice_speed: Controls speed of voice. Value ranging from [0.5,2]. Lower value means slower
              speech, while higher value means faster speech rate. If unset, default value 1
              will apply.

          voice_temperature: Controls how stable the voice is. Value ranging from [0,2]. Lower value means
              more stable, and higher value means more variant speech generation. Currently
              this setting only applies to `11labs` voices. If unset, default value 1 will
              apply.

          voicemail_detection_timeout_ms: Configures when to stop running voicemail detection, as it becomes unlikely to
              hit voicemail after a couple minutes, and keep running it will only have
              negative impact. The minimum value allowed is 5,000 ms (5 s), and maximum value
              allowed is 180,000 (3 minutes). By default, this is set to 30,000 (30 s).

          voicemail_message: The message to be played when the call enters a voicemail. Note that this
              feature is only available for phone calls. If you want to hangup after hitting
              voicemail, set this to empty string.

          voicemail_option: If this option is set, the call will try to detect voicemail in the first 3
              minutes of the call. Actions defined (hangup, or leave a message) will be
              applied when the voicemail is detected. Set this to null to disable voicemail
              detection.

          volume: If set, will control the volume of the agent. Value ranging from [0,2]. Lower
              value means quieter agent speech, while higher value means louder agent speech.
              If unset, default value 1 will apply.

          webhook_timeout_ms: The timeout for the webhook in milliseconds. If not set, default value of 10000
              will apply.

          webhook_url: The webhook for agent to listen to call events. See what events it would get at
              [webhook doc](/features/webhook). If set, will binds webhook events for this
              agent to the specified url, and will ignore the account level webhook for this
              agent. Set to `null` to remove webhook url from this agent.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

        Create a new agent

        Args:
          response_engine: The Response Engine to attach to the agent. It is used to generate responses for
              the agent. You need to create a Response Engine first before attaching it to an
              agent.

          voice_id: Unique voice id used for the agent. Find list of available voices and their
              preview in Dashboard.

          agent_name: The name of the agent. Only used for your own reference.

          allow_user_dtmf: If set to true, DTMF input will be accepted and processed. If false, any DTMF
              input will be ignored. Default to true.

          ambient_sound: If set, will add ambient environment sound to the call to make experience more
              realistic. Currently supports the following options:

              - `coffee-shop`: Coffee shop ambience with people chatting in background.
                [Listen to Ambience](https://retell-utils-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/coffee-shop.wav)
              - `convention-hall`: Convention hall ambience, with some echo and people
                chatting in background.

                [Listen to Ambience](https://retell-utils-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-noise.wav)
              - `call-center`: Call center work noise.
                [Listen to Ambience](https://retell-utils-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/call-center.wav)
                Set to `null` to remove ambient sound from this agent.

          ambient_sound_volume: If set, will control the volume of the ambient sound. Value ranging from [0,2].
              Lower value means quieter ambient sound, while higher value means louder ambient
              sound. If unset, default value 1 will apply.

          analysis_successful_prompt: Prompt to determine whether the post call or chat analysis should mark the
              interaction as successful. Set to null to use the default prompt.

          analysis_summary_prompt: Prompt to guide how the post call or chat analysis summary should be generated.
              When unset, the default system prompt is used. Set to null to use the default
              prompt.

          backchannel_frequency: Only applicable when enable_backchannel is true. Controls how often the agent
              would backchannel when a backchannel is possible. Value ranging from [0,1].
              Lower value means less frequent backchannel, while higher value means more
              frequent backchannel. If unset, default value 0.8 will apply.

          backchannel_words: Only applicable when enable_backchannel is true. A list of words that the agent
              would use as backchannel. If not set, default backchannel words will apply.
              Check out
              [backchannel default words](/agent/interaction-configuration#backchannel) for
              more details. Note that certain voices do not work too well with certain words,
              so it's recommended to experiment before adding any words.

          begin_message_delay_ms: If set, will delay the first message by the specified amount of milliseconds, so
              that it gives user more time to prepare to take the call. Valid range is [0,
              5000]. If not set or set to 0, agent will speak immediately. Only applicable
              when agent speaks first.

          boosted_keywords: Provide a customized list of keywords to bias the transcriber model, so that
              these words are more likely to get transcribed. Commonly used for names, brands,
              street, etc.

          custom_stt_config: Custom STT configuration. Only used when stt_mode is set to custom.

          data_storage_setting: Granular setting to manage how Retell stores sensitive data (transcripts,
              recordings, logs, etc.). This replaces the deprecated
              `opt_out_sensitive_data_storage` field.

              - `everything`: Store all data including transcripts, recordings, and logs.
              - `everything_except_pii`: Store data without PII when PII is detected.
              - `basic_attributes_only`: Store only basic attributes; no
                transcripts/recordings/logs. If not set, default value of "everything" will
                apply.

          denoising_mode: If set, determines what denoising mode to use. Default to noise-cancellation.

          enable_backchannel: Controls whether the agent would backchannel (agent interjects the speaker with
              phrases like "yeah", "uh-huh" to signify interest and engagement). Backchannel
              when enabled tends to show up more in longer user utterances. If not set, agent
              will not backchannel.

          enable_voicemail_detection: If set to true, will detect whether the call enters a voicemail. Note that this
              feature is only available for phone calls.

          end_call_after_silence_ms: If users stay silent for a period after agent speech, end the call. The minimum
              value allowed is 10,000 ms (10 s). By default, this is set to 600000 (10 min).

          fallback_voice_ids: When TTS provider for the selected voice is experiencing outages, we would use
              fallback voices listed here for the agent. Voice id and the fallback voice ids
              must be from different TTS providers. The system would go through the list in
              order, if the first one in the list is also having outage, it would use the next
              one. Set to null to remove voice fallback for the agent.

          interruption_sensitivity: Controls how sensitive the agent is to user interruptions. Value ranging from
              [0,1]. Lower value means it will take longer / more words for user to interrupt
              agent, while higher value means it's easier for user to interrupt agent. If
              unset, default value 1 will apply. When this is set to 0, agent would never be
              interrupted.

          is_public: Whether the agent is public. When set to true, the agent is available for public
              agent preview link.

          language: Specifies what language (and dialect) the speech recognition will operate in.
              For instance, selecting `en-GB` optimizes speech recognition for British
              English. If unset, will use default value `en-US`. Select `multi` for
              multilingual support.

          max_call_duration_ms: Maximum allowed length for the call, will force end the call if reached. The
              minimum value allowed is 60,000 ms (1 min), and maximum value allowed is
              7,200,000 (2 hours). By default, this is set to 3,600,000 (1 hour).

          normalize_for_speech: If set to true, will normalize the some part of text (number, currency, date,
              etc) to spoken to its spoken form for more consistent speech synthesis
              (sometimes the voice synthesize system itself might read these wrong with the
              raw text). For example, it will convert "Call my number 2137112342 on Jul 5th,
              2024 for the $24.12 payment" to "Call my number two one three seven one one two
              three four two on july fifth, twenty twenty four for the twenty four dollars
              twelve cents payment" before starting audio generation.

          opt_in_signed_url: Whether this agent opts in for signed URLs for public logs and recordings. When
              enabled, the generated URLs will include security signatures that restrict
              access and automatically expire after 24 hours.

          pii_config: Configuration for PII scrubbing from transcripts and recordings.

          post_call_analysis_data: Post call analysis data to extract from the call. This data will augment the
              pre-defined variables extracted in the call analysis. This will be available
              after the call ends.

          post_call_analysis_model: The model to use for post call analysis. Default to gpt-4.1-mini.

          pronunciation_dictionary: A list of words / phrases and their pronunciation to be used to guide the audio
              synthesize for consistent pronunciation. Currently only supported for English &
              11labs voices. Set to null to remove pronunciation dictionary from this agent.

          reminder_max_count: If set, controls how many times agent would remind user when user is
              unresponsive. Must be a non negative integer. If unset, default value of 1 will
              apply (remind once). Set to 0 to disable agent from reminding.

          reminder_trigger_ms: If set (in milliseconds), will trigger a reminder to the agent to speak if the
              user has been silent for the specified duration after some agent speech. Must be
              a positive number. If unset, default value of 10000 ms (10 s) will apply.

          responsiveness: Controls how responsive is the agent. Value ranging from [0,1]. Lower value
              means less responsive agent (wait more, respond slower), while higher value
              means faster exchanges (respond when it can). If unset, default value 1 will
              apply.

          ring_duration_ms: If set, the phone ringing will last for the specified amount of milliseconds.
              This applies for both outbound call ringtime, and call transfer ringtime.
              Default to 30000 (30 s). Valid range is [5000, 90000].

          signed_url_expiration_ms: The expiration time for the signed url in milliseconds. Only applicable when
              opt_in_signed_url is true. If not set, default value of 86400000 (24 hours) will
              apply.

          stt_mode: If set, determines whether speech to text should focus on latency or accuracy.
              Default to fast mode. When set to custom, custom_stt_config must be provided.

          version_description: Optional description of the agent version. Used for your own reference and
              documentation.

          vocab_specialization: If set, determines the vocabulary set to use for transcription. This setting
              only applies for English agents, for non English agent, this setting is a no-op.
              Default to general.

          voice_model: Select the voice model used for the selected voice. Each provider has a set of
              available voice models. Set to null to remove voice model selection, and default
              ones will apply. Check out dashboard for more details of each voice model.

          voice_speed: Controls speed of voice. Value ranging from [0.5,2]. Lower value means slower
              speech, while higher value means faster speech rate. If unset, default value 1
              will apply.

          voice_temperature: Controls how stable the voice is. Value ranging from [0,2]. Lower value means
              more stable, and higher value means more variant speech generation. Currently
              this setting only applies to `11labs` voices. If unset, default value 1 will
              apply.

          voicemail_detection_timeout_ms: Configures when to stop running voicemail detection, as it becomes unlikely to
              hit voicemail after a couple minutes, and keep running it will only have
              negative impact. The minimum value allowed is 5,000 ms (5 s), and maximum value
              allowed is 180,000 (3 minutes). By default, this is set to 30,000 (30 s).

          voicemail_message: The message to be played when the call enters a voicemail. Note that this
              feature is only available for phone calls. If you want to hangup after hitting
              voicemail, set this to empty string.

          voicemail_option: If this option is set, the call will try to detect voicemail in the first 3
              minutes of the call. Actions defined (hangup, or leave a message) will be
              applied when the voicemail is detected. Set this to null to disable voicemail
              detection.

          volume: If set, will control the volume of the agent. Value ranging from [0,2]. Lower
              value means quieter agent speech, while higher value means louder agent speech.
              If unset, default value 1 will apply.

          webhook_timeout_ms: The timeout for the webhook in milliseconds. If not set, default value of 10000
              will apply.

          webhook_url: The webhook for agent to listen to call events. See what events it would get at
              [webhook doc](/features/webhook). If set, will binds webhook events for this
              agent to the specified url, and will ignore the account level webhook for this
              agent. Set to `null` to remove webhook url from this agent.

        Update an existing agent's latest draft version

        Args:
          version: Optional version of the API to use for this request. Default to latest version.

          agent_name: The name of the agent. Only used for your own reference.

          allow_user_dtmf: If set to true, DTMF input will be accepted and processed. If false, any DTMF
              input will be ignored. Default to true.

          ambient_sound: If set, will add ambient environment sound to the call to make experience more
              realistic. Currently supports the following options:

              - `coffee-shop`: Coffee shop ambience with people chatting in background.
                [Listen to Ambience](https://retell-utils-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/coffee-shop.wav)
              - `convention-hall`: Convention hall ambience, with some echo and people

              - `call-center`: Call center work noise.
                [Listen to Ambience](https://retell-utils-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/call-center.wav)
                Set to `null` to remove ambient sound from this agent.

          ambient_sound_volume: If set, will control the volume of the ambient sound. Value ranging from [0,2].
              Lower value means quieter ambient sound, while higher value means louder ambient
              sound. If unset, default value 1 will apply.

          analysis_successful_prompt: Prompt to determine whether the post call or chat analysis should mark the
              interaction as successful. Set to null to use the default prompt.

          analysis_summary_prompt: Prompt to guide how the post call or chat analysis summary should be generated.
              When unset, the default system prompt is used. Set to null to use the default
              prompt.

          backchannel_frequency: Only applicable when enable_backchannel is true. Controls how often the agent
              would backchannel when a backchannel is possible. Value ranging from [0,1].
              Lower value means less frequent backchannel, while higher value means more
              frequent backchannel. If unset, default value 0.8 will apply.

          backchannel_words: Only applicable when enable_backchannel is true. A list of words that the agent
              would use as backchannel. If not set, default backchannel words will apply.
              Check out
              [backchannel default words](/agent/interaction-configuration#backchannel) for
              more details. Note that certain voices do not work too well with certain words,
              so it's recommended to experiment before adding any words.

          begin_message_delay_ms: If set, will delay the first message by the specified amount of milliseconds, so
              that it gives user more time to prepare to take the call. Valid range is [0,
              5000]. If not set or set to 0, agent will speak immediately. Only applicable
              when agent speaks first.

          boosted_keywords: Provide a customized list of keywords to bias the transcriber model, so that
              these words are more likely to get transcribed. Commonly used for names, brands,
              street, etc.

          custom_stt_config: Custom STT configuration. Only used when stt_mode is set to custom.

          data_storage_setting: Granular setting to manage how Retell stores sensitive data (transcripts,
              recordings, logs, etc.). This replaces the deprecated
              `opt_out_sensitive_data_storage` field.

              - `everything`: Store all data including transcripts, recordings, and logs.
              - `everything_except_pii`: Store data without PII when PII is detected.
              - `basic_attributes_only`: Store only basic attributes; no
                transcripts/recordings/logs. If not set, default value of "everything" will
                apply.

          denoising_mode: If set, determines what denoising mode to use. Default to noise-cancellation.

          enable_backchannel: Controls whether the agent would backchannel (agent interjects the speaker with
              phrases like "yeah", "uh-huh" to signify interest and engagement). Backchannel
              when enabled tends to show up more in longer user utterances. If not set, agent
              will not backchannel.

          enable_voicemail_detection: If set to true, will detect whether the call enters a voicemail. Note that this
              feature is only available for phone calls.

          end_call_after_silence_ms: If users stay silent for a period after agent speech, end the call. The minimum
              value allowed is 10,000 ms (10 s). By default, this is set to 600000 (10 min).

          fallback_voice_ids: When TTS provider for the selected voice is experiencing outages, we would use
              fallback voices listed here for the agent. Voice id and the fallback voice ids
              must be from different TTS providers. The system would go through the list in
              order, if the first one in the list is also having outage, it would use the next
              one. Set to null to remove voice fallback for the agent.

          interruption_sensitivity: Controls how sensitive the agent is to user interruptions. Value ranging from
              [0,1]. Lower value means it will take longer / more words for user to interrupt
              agent, while higher value means it's easier for user to interrupt agent. If
              unset, default value 1 will apply. When this is set to 0, agent would never be
              interrupted.

          is_public: Whether the agent is public. When set to true, the agent is available for public
              agent preview link.

          language: Specifies what language (and dialect) the speech recognition will operate in.
              For instance, selecting `en-GB` optimizes speech recognition for British
              English. If unset, will use default value `en-US`. Select `multi` for
              multilingual support.

          max_call_duration_ms: Maximum allowed length for the call, will force end the call if reached. The
              minimum value allowed is 60,000 ms (1 min), and maximum value allowed is
              7,200,000 (2 hours). By default, this is set to 3,600,000 (1 hour).

          normalize_for_speech: If set to true, will normalize the some part of text (number, currency, date,
              etc) to spoken to its spoken form for more consistent speech synthesis
              (sometimes the voice synthesize system itself might read these wrong with the
              raw text). For example, it will convert "Call my number 2137112342 on Jul 5th,
              2024 for the $24.12 payment" to "Call my number two one three seven one one two
              three four two on july fifth, twenty twenty four for the twenty four dollars
              twelve cents payment" before starting audio generation.

          opt_in_signed_url: Whether this agent opts in for signed URLs for public logs and recordings. When
              enabled, the generated URLs will include security signatures that restrict
              access and automatically expire after 24 hours.

          pii_config: Configuration for PII scrubbing from transcripts and recordings.

          post_call_analysis_data: Post call analysis data to extract from the call. This data will augment the
              pre-defined variables extracted in the call analysis. This will be available
              after the call ends.

          post_call_analysis_model: The model to use for post call analysis. Default to gpt-4.1-mini.

          pronunciation_dictionary: A list of words / phrases and their pronunciation to be used to guide the audio
              synthesize for consistent pronunciation. Currently only supported for English &
              11labs voices. Set to null to remove pronunciation dictionary from this agent.

          reminder_max_count: If set, controls how many times agent would remind user when user is
              unresponsive. Must be a non negative integer. If unset, default value of 1 will
              apply (remind once). Set to 0 to disable agent from reminding.

          reminder_trigger_ms: If set (in milliseconds), will trigger a reminder to the agent to speak if the
              user has been silent for the specified duration after some agent speech. Must be
              a positive number. If unset, default value of 10000 ms (10 s) will apply.

          response_engine: The Response Engine to attach to the agent. It is used to generate responses for
              the agent. You need to create a Response Engine first before attaching it to an
              agent.

          responsiveness: Controls how responsive is the agent. Value ranging from [0,1]. Lower value
              means less responsive agent (wait more, respond slower), while higher value
              means faster exchanges (respond when it can). If unset, default value 1 will
              apply.

          ring_duration_ms: If set, the phone ringing will last for the specified amount of milliseconds.
              This applies for both outbound call ringtime, and call transfer ringtime.
              Default to 30000 (30 s). Valid range is [5000, 90000].

          signed_url_expiration_ms: The expiration time for the signed url in milliseconds. Only applicable when
              opt_in_signed_url is true. If not set, default value of 86400000 (24 hours) will
              apply.

          stt_mode: If set, determines whether speech to text should focus on latency or accuracy.
              Default to fast mode. When set to custom, custom_stt_config must be provided.

          version_description: Optional description of the agent version. Used for your own reference and
              documentation.

          vocab_specialization: If set, determines the vocabulary set to use for transcription. This setting
              only applies for English agents, for non English agent, this setting is a no-op.
              Default to general.

          voice_id: Unique voice id used for the agent. Find list of available voices and their
              preview in Dashboard.

          voice_model: Select the voice model used for the selected voice. Each provider has a set of
              available voice models. Set to null to remove voice model selection, and default
              ones will apply. Check out dashboard for more details of each voice model.

          voice_speed: Controls speed of voice. Value ranging from [0.5,2]. Lower value means slower
              speech, while higher value means faster speech rate. If unset, default value 1
              will apply.

          voice_temperature: Controls how stable the voice is. Value ranging from [0,2]. Lower value means
              more stable, and higher value means more variant speech generation. Currently
              this setting only applies to `11labs` voices. If unset, default value 1 will
              apply.

          voicemail_detection_timeout_ms: Configures when to stop running voicemail detection, as it becomes unlikely to
              hit voicemail after a couple minutes, and keep running it will only have
              negative impact. The minimum value allowed is 5,000 ms (5 s), and maximum value
              allowed is 180,000 (3 minutes). By default, this is set to 30,000 (30 s).

          voicemail_message: The message to be played when the call enters a voicemail. Note that this
              feature is only available for phone calls. If you want to hangup after hitting
              voicemail, set this to empty string.

          voicemail_option: If this option is set, the call will try to detect voicemail in the first 3
              minutes of the call. Actions defined (hangup, or leave a message) will be
              applied when the voicemail is detected. Set this to null to disable voicemail
              detection.

          volume: If set, will control the volume of the agent. Value ranging from [0,2]. Lower
              value means quieter agent speech, while higher value means louder agent speech.
              If unset, default value 1 will apply.

          webhook_timeout_ms: The timeout for the webhook in milliseconds. If not set, default value of 10000
              will apply.

          webhook_url: The webhook for agent to listen to call events. See what events it would get at
              [webhook doc](/features/webhook). If set, will binds webhook events for this
              agent to the specified url, and will ignore the account level webhook for this
              agent. Set to `null` to remove webhook url from this agent.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds
